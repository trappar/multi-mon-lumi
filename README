Multi-Monitor Illumination
================

A simple but useful Windows application for keeping focused on the task at hand. Darkens monitors that your mouse isn't currently in so they won't be as distracting.

There's nothing to set up, just run the included MultiMonLumi.exe inside the bin directory. The application has no GUI, it will just run in your taskbar until closed.

You can lock/unlock the selected monitor by pressing Win+Alt+L

Enjoy!
